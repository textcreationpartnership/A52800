         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We read how the Mighty Angel of the Covenant, had a very little Book open in his Hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.2. The <hi>Greek</hi> Word is [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] a double Diminutive, as Chriſt calls them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. The <hi>Bible</hi> it ſelf is but a little Book, in compariſon of thoſe vaſt Folio's of School-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Popiſh Decretals, wherewith the World is peſter'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that <hi>little Book</hi> was not ſhut or ſealed, but it was open by the
<pb facs="tcp:42174:3"/> Lamb's Purchaſe: 'Tis the Work of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> to keep it ſhut, yea, and it muſt alſo be eaten, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. that is, it muſt go down and be <hi>Hid in our Hearts,</hi> Pſal. 119.11. then the ſimpleſt Soul may have right Conceptions of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>little Book</hi> hath coſt me great Study and Labour to compoſe it, that it might contain the very Cream and Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the beſt Authors upon this Subject: Moreover, It hath coſt me likewiſe many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Prayers to God, and many Earneſt Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with God, that I might not be one of thoſe <hi>that rebel againſt the Light,</hi> Job 24.13. but that in <hi>His Light I might ſee Light,</hi> Pſal. 36.9. and to have my Eyes <hi>anointed with Chriſt's Eye-ſalve,</hi> Rev. 3.18. that I might ſee more clearly into theſe Profound Points, which hath very much puzzled ſo much of the Chriſtian World. Inſomuch that the <hi>Orthodox</hi> do complain in our Day (only with a little Difference) as bleſſed <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> did in his Day, who then ſigh'd out thoſe ſad Words [<hi>Totus Mundus eſt Arrianus</hi>] ſo 'tis the ſad ſigh of our preſent Times, that [<hi>Totus Mundus eſt Arminianus</hi>].</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Leſt this overflowing Deluge <pb facs="tcp:42174:3"/> ſhould bring Deſtruction upon us, there is great need that ſome Servants of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould run to ſtop the farther ſpreading of this Plague and Leproſie: Thus <hi>Moſes,</hi> God's Servant, <hi>ſtood in the Gap, and ſtopped the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 106.23.
<hi>&amp;</hi> Numb. 14.10,11,12., to 20. And at another Time this
<hi>Moſes</hi> (who was quick-ſighted by his great Familiarity with God) did ſoon <hi>ſee that Wrath was gone out from the Lord againſt Iſrael,</hi> then he commands <hi>Aaron to run,</hi> and take a <hi>Cenſer and offer up an Atonement,</hi> &amp;c. all which when <hi>Aaron</hi> had done,
<hi>the Plague was ſtayed,</hi> Numb. 16.46,47,48. And the Neglect of this Duty the Lord complains of, that <hi>He found none of his Servants to ſtand in the Gap,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.30. While I was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thoſe Things, the Lord ſtirred up my Spirit, to do as is done in Common Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when every one runs with the beſt Bucket he can get, wherewith to quench the Devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flames, and to ſtop them, that they may not proceed to lay all waſte before them.</p>

<hi>Paul</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated <hi>Epiphonema</hi> is, the Pleaſure of his own Will, the Pleaſure of his own Will, the Counſel of his own Will, but more fully in that <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13,15. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifying <pb n="28" facs="tcp:42174:18"/> this Truth in <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau:</hi> Both the Prophet and the Apoſtle makes this Inſtance the fulleſt Exemplification of Free Election,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. They do not bring in for an Inſtance, that of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abol</hi> in the beginning of the Old World; or that of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Ham</hi> in the beginning of the New World; but this of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> For, (1.) Theſe two were
<hi>Fratres Utero</hi> (yet not <hi>Animo</hi>) at one and the ſame time, they laid together in the ſame Womb, and were born at the ſame time (for
<hi>Jacob</hi> took hold of <hi>Eſau's</hi> Heel) ſo the contrary Diſpoſal of theſe two doth more illuſtrate the free Predeſtination of God, than of any other two whatſoever. (2.) In <hi>Jacob</hi> there began to be a diſtinguiſhed People from all the World, even a Church unto God; as of
<hi>Eſau</hi> ſprang alſo a perſecuting Seed, yet before they had done either Good or Evil, <hi>Jacob</hi> was loved and <hi>Eſau</hi> hated: God had no regard to Faith in the one, or Infidelity in the other, whereby they might be differenced the One from the Other; they were at that time (when God's Oracle paſs'd upon them) already conceiv'd in Sin in their Mother's Womb, and if there were any Preheminence, <hi>Eſau</hi> had it, as being the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born.

Whom the Father elects, the Son redeems, and the Holy Ghoſt ſanctifies: If then there be an Univerſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then there muſt be an Univerſal Election, and an Univerſal Sanctification, and ſo (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence) an Univerſal Salvation too. That the Son redeems no more than the Father elects, is evident from two Scriptures, the firſt is <hi>John</hi> 5.23. the Son muſt be honoured as the Father, <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42174:38"/> but to ſay [that the Son redeemed all, and the Father elected but few] is to give greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Second Perſon than to the firſt, and to make an Inequality in their Operations; the Second Scripture is <hi>John</hi> 17.9,10. <hi>All thine are mine, and all mine are thine,</hi> &amp;c. They were the Father's by Election, before they be the Son's by Redemption; <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me,</hi> v. 6, 8. Chriſt redeems only thoſe whom God gave him to redeem. Hence God's Book of Life (wherein the Number of the Elect is recorded) is call'd alſo the Lamb's Book of Life, to intimate that the Number of thoſe Elected by the Father, is commenſurate with thoſe redeemed by the Son. And that Chriſt redeems no more but whom the Spirit ſanctifies, appears likewiſe from 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.6,7. there muſt be Water to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, where there is Blood to redeem: Chriſt's Oblation is not of a larger Extent than the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's Operation. Thus it is made apparent, that all the Three Perſons in the Trinity have all one Object and Deſign of Love; the Son's deſign for Redemption hath not a greater Latitude then the Father's for Election, and the Spirit's for Sanctification; all equal in Eſſence, Honour and Operation.</p>

<hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The Aſſumption appears, as, 1. His <hi>Juſtice: Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari pretium &amp; captivum non redimi adverſatur Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiae:</hi> If Chriſt paid the Price for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> &amp;c. then reconciled Souls are unjuſtly damned, <hi>ut ſupra.</hi> This
<hi>Hypotheſis</hi> ſets the Death of Chriſt in a direct Oppoſition to God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and how could Chriſt dye for <hi>Judas</hi>'s Sin, when Chriſt's Death was his very Sin; as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, Father, receive into thy Favour thoſe whom I know thou wilt never do ſo (being before of old ordained to deſtruction, <hi>Jude</hi> 4.) This is to make Religion a Laughing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock. 2. His <hi>Wiſdom:</hi> As if God ſhould love and hate the ſame Perſon at the ſame Time; <hi>Eſau</hi> muſt be loved, in giving Chriſt to dye for him, yet hated, as being ordain'd to Death from all Eternity; and what is this but Childrens play, in giving
<hi>Judas</hi> a Ranſom with one Hand, and ſending him to his place for his (ſatisfied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, and remitted) Sin, with the other Hand? 3. His
<hi>Power:</hi> If Chriſt died intentionally (as to God) for all, then God's Intentions are fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, (ſeeing all are not ſaved) and then he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42174:44"/> is not Omnipotent, if croſs'd in his Deſigns by the Work of his own Hands; and to ſay, that Freedom was obtain'd by Chriſt's Death for one, but not that he ſhould be freed, is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. The End cannot be ſever'd from the Action: if God will'd that Redemption might be obtain'd of him, it was, that it might be applied to ſome; and if to ſome and not to all, then there is ſome Diſparity in the Impetration it ſelf, and in the Intention of it, and not in the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only; and ſo the Diſtinction falls.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This Diſtinction hath no place in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Chriſt, for therein they are both uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Chriſt's aim being to beſtow what he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, he obtains nothing but what he applies, for doth he apply any thing which he did not obtain, <hi>Deus et Natura nil faciunt fruſtra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is abſurd to ſay that Redemption is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, when both he that obtains, and he of whom it is obtained, do know it ſhall never be applied; nor ever profit thoſe for whom (they ſay) it is obtained.</p>

                        <p n="11">11. The Intention of God cannot be condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional (on our believing) for our believing adds nothing to the Intrinſical Sufficiency of Chriſt's Satisfaction, neither doth our not believing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh it.

<hi>Job</hi> 13.7,8. 'Tis indeed an Advancing of his Mercy, but not of his Truth in the former, and of the Will of Man, (Embalming a dead Carcaſe) above the Wiil of God in the latter. The Will of Man is Naturally a ſelf-determining Power and Principle, and bears God's Image, as it hath a Dominion over the whole Man; but ſince the Fall hath the ſtrong Byaſſe of Sin upon it.

<hi>You hath he quickened, who were dead,</hi> &amp;c. he doth not ſay, half dead, as the Man was that fell among Thieves, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.30. but he means, ſtark dead, as to Spiritual Life: <hi>There is no manner of good thing in us,</hi> Rom. 7.18. <hi>And we are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of our ſelves to think a good thought,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. till Chriſt (who is Life and a Quickning Spirit) come to quicken us; <hi>Without him we can do nothing,</hi> John 15.5. he doth not ſay, many things or few things, but nothing; <hi>From him is our Fruit found,</hi> Hoſ. 14.8. both the Bud of good Deſires, the Bloſſom of good Purpoſes, and the Fruit of good Actions. <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod (a dry ſtick without a Root) is a fit Emblem; it budded, bloſſom'd and brought forth Almonds; this was not done by any Inward Principle or Power of Nature, but it was ſolely and wholly the Work of God: So
<hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s dry Bones were made to live; nothing of that Life was from themſelves, but all from God. Thus it is in this Spiritual Vivification, we cannot contribute any thing (no not the hundred Part that, is <hi>ejuſdem naturae,</hi> of the ſame Nature with the 99.) to this Glorious Work; we have no <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum <pb n="98" facs="tcp:42174:53"/> Principium,</hi> whereby to diſpoſe our ſelves to will that which is truly good; we cannot ſo much as call Chriſt Lord, but by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. If there be no Life, but through Union with Chriſt, then till we be engrafted into that bleſſed and bleeding Vine, we cannot bring ſorth any fruit unto God; and
'tis not any Natural Power or Principle in us that can Engraft us into Chriſt, for Faith is the Engrafting Grace, and that is the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> Eph. 2.8. the Grace whereby the Juſt live, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.5. and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt dwells in our Hearts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. till then we are dead, and have no Free-will to Good.
